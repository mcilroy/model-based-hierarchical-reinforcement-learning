% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have recently shown improvement over existing approaches to some problems such as game playing. However, reinforcement learning models still suffer from having to scale to large state spaces. Hierarchical reinforcement learning has been shown to aid in scaling RL techniques by abstracting actions. We propose a model-based hierarchical reinforcement learning approach using monte carlo tree search. We found that the overall number of training trials is reduced. This finding illustrates the advantages of model-based learning methods.
